How to Play

1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.
2. You must guess the number within a maximum of 5 attempts.
3. After each guess, you receive a hint:
   · Too big → Your guess is larger than the target number.
   · Too small → Your guess is smaller than the target number.
   · So close → Your guess is very close (+1 extra attempt rewarded).
   · You win → You've won!
4. If you fail to guess correctly within 5 attempts, you lose the game.
